            Hi! I'm Serkan. I was born in 1999. I live in Ä°stanbul and study as a Computer
            Engineering student. I like to build
            <TextLink text=" open-source projects " url="https://github.com/syhnserkan" /> for fun
            an experience.

            When I start university, I didn't know anything about programming. I wrote C/C++ for
            algorithm in the first year. After the first year, I started to write C# for desktop
            applications. But I realized, desktop applications are not written very much. When I
            passing to the third grade, I taught myself how to make websites first as a hobby and
            later as a professional programmer. Firstly, I started frontend technologies like HTML,
            CSS and Javascript. After that I took a brief look at Jquery but I didn't like it.

            What did I learn for backend ? I learned Asp.NET MVC, entity framework, and MSSQL.

            Nowadays, I have mostly worked React.js, Next.js, Typescript, and Css frameworks (Sass,
