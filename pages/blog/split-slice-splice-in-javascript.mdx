Today, I want to talk about **split()**, **splice()**, and **slice()** method. You know there are lots of functions with scarily similar names in land of javascript. That's why javascript methods can be confused each other sometimes.

## Split()

Split is a function that split the given string into an array of substrings. The split method doesn't change the original string array and will return the new array.

### Example

## Slice()

Slice method doesn't change the original array. It is method of both arrays and strings. Slice method can take two arguments. First argument is required, second argument is optional.

- First argument that represent where to start selection.
- Second argument that represent where to end selection.

## Splice()

Splice method changes the original array. It can remove element, replace existing elements, or add new elements to array. It can take 3+ arguments.

- First argument is index and requried.
- Second argument is optional and represent the number of items be removed.
- Third argument is optional and represent the number of items be added. Argument can be increased.

Sometimes we want to remove items from array and we can use **pop()** and **shift()** methods instead of **splice()** method. But it is easy to use and we can remove more than one item or add to the array.

## Conclusion

**Split()** method is used for strings array, **slice()** method is used for both arrays and strings. **Splice()** method is used for only arrays.
